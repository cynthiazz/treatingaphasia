							<div class="section-subtitle"> What is Apahasia? </div>
							<div class="section-block"> Aphasia is an acquired language disorder resulting from damage to the brain. It is most commonly caused by stroke within the language-dominant (usually left) hemisphere. Although each individual's symptoms differ, aphasia involves varying degrees of impairment in four main areas: spoken language expression, spoken language comprehension, written expression, and reading comprehension. </div>
						</div>
						<div class="section-box"> 
							<div class="section-subtitle"> Treating Aphasia </div>
							<div class="section-block">There are two categories of treatment for aphasia. The first is restorative, which aims to improve or restore the impaired functions. It focuses on the physiological functions or structures of the body. The second is compensatory, which tries to compensate for deficits that cannot be retrained or restored. It focuses more on activities and participation. </div>

								<div> Music therapy started in SLP with theory about how “prosodic features of articulation”  (J. Hurkmans et al. 2015) can be found in musical elements. Music and singing engage different parts of the brain than standard speech, and so many - but not all - forms of aphasia can be addressed through music therapy. </div>

								<div> Musical therapy often raises the morale of people with aphasia, and so complements other more demanding forms of rehabilitation. This therapeutic approach programme follows rate-rhythm control strategies, which considers the dynamics of articulations and timing of speech production, while also paying attention to fluency, accuracy, and consistency. </div>

							<div class="section-subtitle"> Example </div>
							<div class="section-block"> 
								<div> One example of music therapy consists of people playing instruments, and tapping their hand on a drum to the beat of specific lyrics in music. During the course of music therapy, it has been shown to be pertinent for patients to be mindful of their process and how music is directly impacting their symptoms. A feedback loop has been shown to increase the chances of how therapy influences people throughout the course of music therapy, as researchers find this can increase progress. </div>

							<div class="section-subtitle"> Does the type of music matter? </div>
							<div class="section-block"> 
								<div> The type of music used is not necessarily important, unless we want to consider the direct impact on the brain regarding how people interpret music. It is important for SLPs to consider the background and cultural association with music tone among individuals because there may be better results if people feel more connected to certains kinds of music. </div>
								<div> When people have feelings towards different kinds of music, it can have a different impact on the brain. Nonetheless, all music can activate different areas of the brain depending on the emotional response. Support groups for aphasia sometimes form their own choirs as part of their activities. </div>

								<div> Often abbricated as VNeST, this is a type of aphasia treatment that tries to create word associations to assist in the retrieval of words. It focuses on verbs to activate the relationship between the verb name and their semantic meaning. It also aims to help in the production of basic syntactic structures of sentences, such as the subject-object-verb sequence, which is common in English. </div>

								<div> After over two decades of research, ASHA has revealed how LPAA can offer a greater sense of agency and emphasize support groups. LPAA is a nonclinical approach that is meant to treat symptoms of aphasia; this approach can help individuals participate in daily activities, fulfill goals, and meet needs. The treatment focuses on communication atmospheres and environmental factors that affect one’s life at home and in the community of the person. </div>
								<div> The ultimate objective behind this holistic intervention approach is to encourage people with aphasia to stay motivated in life as a means to produce a meaningful life and enhance their quality of life (QoL). Overall, LPAA has become a prominent therapeutic approach to pay attention to one’s thoughts during daily life routine and interpersonal interactions. </div>
								<div> The ultimate goal behind LPAA is to support people in all areas of their lives, recognizing the four categories below: </div>

								</div>
								<div> In the following video, Dr. Audrey Holland (core members of the LLPA movement) discusses how it is important for therapists and patients to learn together. This encourages people to engage with real people outside of the clinic in real life situations among real life conversations. </div>
